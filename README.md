## GOOD to know, personnal school project JS PHP MySQL :open_book:
To validate my last web developper training, i have to create alone a personnal project with all technologies and processes i learned.

I chose to create an information website based on ecology. Internet is a great communication platform that can be used for good causes, such as education  and information on the world around us.
This website will be able to highlight the last published article, see all the available articles at a glance and allow registered users to react for 
each article in real time with comments.  
I wanted a clear and usefull informative website with accessible articles that were easy to understand and enjoyable to read on computer or phone.
